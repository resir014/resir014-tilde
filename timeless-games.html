<p>When I started becoming a full-time PC gamer, I've started exploring all kinds of games that I could ever get my hands on, from any genre and background. Sure, I did play some PC games back in the day, but back then I play more on consoles/handhelds than on PCs.</p>

<p>Among all of the games that I own, very few have I realised the importance of these games and how integrative they were in shaping up who I am today..</p>

<p>In Timeless Games, I will curate a list of all the games that I've spent the most time on, had the most enjoyment in, and which experience I'll remember fondly for many years to come.</p>
