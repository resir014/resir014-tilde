Playlist from Shuffle is an idea for a playlist where the order of your playlist is determined by your favourite music player's shuffle feature. The idea for Playlist From Shuffle came up earlier today when I was driving back home whilst listening to my Spotify playlist on shuffle. Upon listening through the shuffled tracks, I've discovered that some of these shuffled tracks flow together really well into one cohesive playlist, so I've decided to experiment with this by taking a snip of some of the tracks in my shuffle list and put them together into a nice playlist, *without* altering the order in which they're shuffled.

The first installment of my Playlist From Shuffle collection is available below. It's pretty short, but hey, at least it's a start. I've also provided a Spotify playlist if that's your thing. If you like this idea, feel free to experiment yourself and share your own playlists which conform to the rules below.

## Rules

* Put your favourite music player on shuffle and put every track being shuffled into your playlist, in order. **Do not** change the order in which they were shuffled.
* There is no mandatory time limit for the playlists, but try to keep them below 2 hours long.

Overall, the rules on how long your playlist should be is pretty laxed, the only important thing is to not alter the order of the shuffle.
