title: How to make YouTube Heroes actually work
lead: "Almost everything of what YouTube Heroes aims to do misses the point. Here's how to fix them."
---

Not so long ago, YouTube announced their new ["YouTube Heroes"](http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/21/13001520/youtube-heroes-comment-moderation-program-announced) scheme, in an attempt to fix the ever-so-terrible content and comment moderation, much to [the disapproval of the YouTube Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU1F7yURZYA) as a whole. Whilst I find the core idea of YouTube Heroes to be quite sound, almost everything of what it aims to do misses the point, mostly the fact that comment moderation is being centralised towards YouTube itself.

Here are two minor points that I came up in order to make YouTube Heroes actually work.

## Moderation should never be centralised

In a highly saturated community like YouTube, centralised moderation only brings more problems than it solves. Leave the moderation part of YouTube Heroes solely under the control of the content creators. Take Reddit for example, where moderation is done based on subreddit, instead of Reddit as a whole. In YouTube's case, Heroes will still take part on comment moderation and stuff, however they work for the content creators that they volunteer to be a "Hero" on. It should never be centralised towards YouTube.

Decentralise your moderation.

## Content creators should be able to provide proper incentive for loyal Heroes

This is quite important, and unfortunately, the current perks that Heroes offer doesn't really give any proper incentive. If you, as a content creator rely mostly on your "Heroes" to weed out bad subtitles, and ensure proper comment moderation, they should be allowed to receive incentives from the content creators. Those who do more to contribute subtitles, comment moderation, etc. should be allowed to receive an incentive as the content creators themselves grant them.

In summary, the core idea behind YouTube Heroes seems to be sensible, however it just misses the whole point and creates more problem than it solves. The "gamification" of moderation to me is just a gimmick-y feature which offers no proper incentive to whoever volunteers to become a "hero". The centralised nature of this new system is also shady at best, because in such a highly saturated community like YouTube, content and comment moderation should fall into the control of the content creators themselves, and not solely on YouTube.

In that case, I hope YouTube sees the parts of YouTube Heroes which are just plain wrong, and are willing to make fixes in order to ensure a safe space for everyone within the YouTube community.
