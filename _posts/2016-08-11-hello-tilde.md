title: Hello, Tilde

Hey there!

This tilde site was originally set up as a landing page for my actual blog at [resir014.github.io](https://resir014.github.io), but then I realised I could just set up a quick blog that mirrors my posts from that page, since tilde.town is a community comprising a bunch of creative people who share their thoughts, might as well share mine over here.

Expect posts that are mostly my personal thoughts on recent goings-on, as well as rambles about computer-related things. I've been trying to write more in the past year or two, so I felt the need to actually have a space where I can drop my thoughts in. I might also diversify my content even further and do more than just blog posts, maybe post my photography collection, and many others too. We'll see.

You can also contact me on the following sites:

* Twitter: [@resir014](https://twitter.com/resir014)
* Tumblr: [resir014.tumblr.com](http://resir014.tumblr.com/)
* GitHub: [resir014](https://github.com/resir014)

Or mail me privately through alpine.
