## Rules

* Put your favourite music player on shuffle and select some of the the shuffled tracks into your playlist. **Do not** change the order in which they were shuffled.
* There is no mandatory time limit for the playlists, but try to keep them below 2 hours long.

Overall, the rules on how long your playlist should be is pretty laxed, the only important thing is to not alter the order of the shuffle.
