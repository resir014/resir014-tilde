The TrackMania games used to be really close to my heart every waking hour. I believe the whole TM series has always been grossly underrated as a proper eSports-style racing, and TrackMania2 really builds on that twitchy-competitive-racing feel that the previous TM games offer. One of the game's best selling points is its diverse modding/mapping community, as well as dedicated servers which offer tons of fun racing.
