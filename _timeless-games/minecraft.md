There's no other game that has made as much of an impact on my life as Minecraft. This was the first ever game that made me determined to explore games of any genre. The simplicity of the design, and the endless possibilities of the open-world, sandbox experience are bound to make your time in the game worthwile.

Whilst I never found single-player to be engaging, the multiplayer experience have introduced me into a whole new world of online interactions. Being involved in a very tight-knit community of players who happen to love the game as much as you are enables you to make friends around the world, which you'll have a lot of fun doing Minecraft gaming evenings with. It was one of the best gaming experience I've ever had, and I would never trade it off for anything else.

The screenshot I used for this page is one the first screenshots I've ever taken on Minecraft (that I know of, at least).
