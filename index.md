# words

### [Posts]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts)

Thoughts on life, and everything in between.

# creative

I try to be creative sometimes. Most of time I did some good stuff, most of the time I didn't.

### [Photography]({{ site.baseurl }}/photography)

Usually I go outside and shoot things with my camera.

### [Music]({{ site.baseurl }}/music)

I listen to songs. I share the ones I like here.

### [Playlists]({{ site.baseurl }}/playlist)

These mixtapes are definitely not fire.
