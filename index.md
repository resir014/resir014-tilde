# welcome

This is the tilde page for resir014, where I post stuff that generally doesn't fit in on my main website. Read more about me [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/about).

You can also find me here:

* [Main website](https://resir014.github.io/) - Projects, writings, ramblings, and thoughts about computers in general.
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/resir014) - Where I mostly shitpost about computers and other generic things.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/resir014) - The dumping ground for most of my failed projects.
