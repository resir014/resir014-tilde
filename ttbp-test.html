			<h5><a href="#20170507">07</a> may 2017</h5>
			<p>Do you know how when you've been worrying too much about a really close friend
that you've formed an emotional connection with, that it just kills you from
the inside? It's kind of that bittersweet feeling which reminds you why you
love your closest friends so much and really care about them, but at the same
time you keep worrying that you've never been a "good" friend to them.</p>
<p>Thing is, I still have people IRL that I'm friends with, and I appreciate them
for being around, but they're not really the same, y'know. For some reason I
just have a closer emotional attachment to my online friends rather than those
in real life.</p>
<p>I've also went through experiences of losing friends mostly because of my own
fault, so I always doubt my social skills. Hell, I almost always doubt that
I've even done the right things to my friends. I fear that I overworry, being
manipulative, pushy, etc. After all, those were the things that made me lose my
past friends in the first place.</p>
<p>I just can't afford to lose another one. I need people around my life, but at
the same time, I don't know how to properly deal with people.</p>
