			<h5><a href="#20170702">02</a> july 2017</h5>
			<p>I've been working on a long-overdue redesign of all my websites over the past
few days. I'm currently writing a new theme for the Jekyll blog, which the
entire website's design will be based off of, and the design is mostly inspired
by <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/arrival/">Mozilla's new brand identity</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a quick sneak-peek, let me know what you guys think!</p>

			<h5><a href="#20170601">01</a> june 2017</h5>
			<p>My phone died earlier this Monday.</p>
<p>Nexus 5X phones are known for its Curse of the Bootloop, which seems to happen
whenever you're running, or just upgraded to, Android Nougat. I tried all
possible <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/03/21/fix-a-brick-fighting-the-nexus-5x-bootloop/">recovery methods</a>
but no dice. It went to the bootloader, but can't restart. A few attempts
later, I couldn't even get it to boot anymore.</p>
<p>So I was phoneless for about 3 days. I do have a backup phone, my old Nexus 4,
and my mom gave me her backup phone with her number as well. Unfortunately, my
Nexus 4 can't stay off the charger for more than a couple minutes, since its
battery is pretty much toast.</p>
<p>But even more than that, there are a lot of things that I missed from my
beloved Nexus 5X. I miss fingerprint locking. I miss fast charging. I miss
being able to get the latest stock Android. It was the best phone that I've
ever had, before the Curse of the Bootloop occured. Unfortunately, with Google
killing off the Nexus line, and the Pixel remains a tad bit overpriced, it's
time to let the Nexus go.</p>
<p>That said, I've placed an order on the <a href="https://oneplus.net/global/3t">OnePlus 3T</a>.
It should be delivered to my office tomorrow.</p>

			<h5><a href="#20170507">07</a> may 2017</h5>
			<p>Do you know how when you've been worrying too much about a really close friend
that you've formed an emotional connection with, that it just kills you from
the inside? It's kind of that bittersweet feeling which reminds you why you
love your closest friends so much and really care about them, but at the same
time you keep worrying that you've never been a "good" friend to them.</p>
<p>Thing is, I still have people IRL that I'm friends with, and I appreciate them
for being around, but they're not really the same, y'know. For some reason I
just have a closer emotional attachment to my online friends rather than those
in real life.</p>
<p>I've also went through experiences of losing friends mostly because of my own
fault, so I always doubt my social skills. Hell, I almost always doubt that
I've even done the right things to my friends. I fear that I overworry, being
manipulative, pushy, etc. After all, those were the things that made me lose my
past friends in the first place.</p>
<p>I just can't afford to lose another one. I need people around my life, but at
the same time, I don't know how to properly deal with people.</p>

<p>I think I've felt this kind of "existential crisis" every time I transitioned
from, say, high school to uni, but I've never felt it this strong.</p>
<p>When I was closing my eyes trying to sleep after my first day at work, I tried
to reflect on my first day. Then everything kind of derailed and I started
thinking about how after this I'll grow old, then my parents will die, then my
friends will die, then ultimately I will die.</p>
<p>Not that I'm crying over it, but fuck.</p>
<p>Oh well, I guess when I'm fully settled in this new job in a couple weeks,
it'll probably be gone.</p>

			<p>Life update, sort of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Been doing generally fine. I had my downs, but things are looking upwards
from here.</li>
<li>Passed university thesis exams. I will graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in
Information Systems.</li>
<li>Got a job as a Junior Web Developer for a local subsidiary of a
multinational company. A field that I've been wanting to get a job for all
my life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you all the townies for your support! Without you guys I wouldn't be
here. Right now I'm slowly getting back to online life after being robbed of
it during my last year of uni.</p>
<p>Here's to the future, and all the possibilities that lie within.</p>

			<p>I'm feeling generally better now, fortunately. It has been a rollercoaster of
emotions last week, but fortunately things are starting to look up.</p>
<p>On another note, my tilde page is finally filled with some content! You can
check out my new photography stuff <a href="https://tilde.town/~resir014/photography/">here</a>,
as well as the songs I've been listening to <a href="https://tilde.town/~resir014/music/">here</a>.
I might need to find more games that I need to put in my Timeless Games list,
however I'll be having my university thesis exam in a few days, so I'll have to
put that off for a few days.</p>

preparing myself for my first ever full-time job as a front-end developer.</p>

<p>My new ttbp page finally looks as shiny as my tilde page. This means that
<a href="https://tilde.town/~resir014/post/"><code>/post</code></a> is sadly going away. I feel that
cross-posting my blog posts from my website to my tilde page feels really
redundant, so I decided against that, and simply announce any new blog posts I
made on ttbp, complete with a link to the post on my main website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all posts migrated from my blog doesn't seem to regenerate properly,
might need to get some help from ~<a href="https://tilde.town/~endorphant">endorphant</a>
for that. Also, huge thanks to ~<a href="https://tilde.town/~mio">mio</a> for their
ideas on theming ttbp!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Everything seems to work now. All old posts are now published!</p>

<p>I mean my blog <a href="https://tilde.town/~resir014/post/">https://tilde.town/~resir014/post/</a> isn't going away. It's just
that I want to jump in and probably get some new experience out of this thing.</p>
<p>Also, if this thing is themeable, I would definitely publish these posts on my page.</p>

<p><em>This post has been hard to write. The initial version of this post was put
together last year, within the course of three months until I stopped working
on it. I have never been able to pour all of these mundane thoughts and
experiences into paper. However, a few weeks ago I removed almost everything
and basically started from scratch. I feel like recent events made me find the
courage to finish this post once and for all.</em></p>

			<h1>Timeless Games</h1>
<p>The day I started transitioning into a full-time PC gamer was the day I started
exploring all kinds of games that I could ever get my hands on, from any genre
and background. Sure, I played more on consoles/handhelds than on PCs back in
the day, but PC gaming was never out of the question.</p>
<p>Among all of the games that I own, very few have I realised the importance of
these games and how important they were in shaping up who I am today. They
provide this weird, emotional attachment which made my experience on these
games worthwile. These games are worthy of mentioning just for that sole
reason.</p>
<p>And that's the reason I set up Timeless Games. It is a curated list of all the
games that I've spent the most time on, had the most enjoyment in, and which
experience I'll remember fondly for many years to come. Most of the games
featured will be PC games, but I'll try to include some console games as well.</p>
<p>To browse the collection, click <a href="https://tilde.town/~resir014/timeless-games/">here</a>.</p>
