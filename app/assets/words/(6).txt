I don't even know if I actually need empathy.

I've been having this moment like, whenever you see your friends feel like shit,
and you... automatically feel like shit as well. You connect with your friend so
much to the point that you empathise with them this way. And, you really want to
make them feel better, but you don't know what it was that could, or you keep
getting anxious to hear about their well-being, like when I knew they're
alright, that's when I'll be alright as well.

That's what I've been feeling over the past few days.

Empathy is hard when it kills you on the inside as well.
