Every time I see the usual "shitting on JS because it's cool" kind of tweet, it
literally made me question every life decision I've ever made.

I literally only seriously started getting into programming when I learned
HTML/CSS, and now I learned JS which is the thing that I've been doing all this
time.

This is my greatest life gamble. Going deep into web development is my
all-or-nothing decision. I thought I was on a roll, until I see...

...that the programming community as a whole actually shit on us for what we are
and what we use, even telling us to "git gud" and learn a real programming
language.

All the negatives started piling in. javascript is a fake programming language,
I'm a fake programmer, I should've been better off flipping burgers at
McDonald's.

I should probably start picking up on learning a "real" programming language
myself (I'm interested in Elixir) but too late, that whole ordeal already made
me insecure as fuck.

So I'm now forever a fake developer.
