I'm sorry if my political viewpoints aren't up to your expectations. Whether
it's too centrist, too left-wing, what have you. I'm sorry.

I'm not usually outspoken about politics for the sake of my own mental health.
Heck, I can't even tell where I am in the spectrum, even though I've taken the
political compass numerous times and received more or less the same results[1].

A friend of mine brought up this idea of "good centrists" vs. "bad centrists",
and how most of the so-called "centrists" on the internet have mostly gravitated
towards the latter[2], and it made me think this through for once.

I actually want to try to figure things out and see things from both sides
instead of just agreeing with everyone so that I don't upset other people, but
at the same time the anxiety grown from having went through a huge faling out
with a former friend made me have this mindset that I can't afford to lose
another friend, so... I'd just blindly agree or not make any comments.

This sucks because I actually want to have a healthy conversation regarding a
lot of these things, even moreso after recent events. However, my mental state
and the white noise social media has generated when it comes to politics made it
near-impossible to even have a healthy conversation on them.

I'll just stay here in my own corner.
