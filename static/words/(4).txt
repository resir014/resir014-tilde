I think I've felt this kind of "existential crisis" every time I transitioned
from, say, high school to uni, but I've never felt it this strong.

When I was closing my eyes trying to sleep last night, I tried to reflect on my
first day ever at work. Then everything kind of derailed and started thinking
about how after this I'll grow old, then my parents will die, then my friends
will die, then ultimately I will die.

Not that I'm crying over it, but fuck.

Oh well, I guess when I'm fully settled in this new job in a couple weeks, it'll
probably be gone.
