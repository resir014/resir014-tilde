I know I've had this one... dangerous trait of mine, and it seems to always
propagate throughout people that I talk to online rather than irl. I know I've
had this, yet I can't seem to get it all away, no matter how hard I tried.

This is one of the reasons of my increasing fear of being judged by people. Idk,
I just can't stop to think people have something in their heads about me that I
don't know, no matter who they are.

It's also why I'm really against any form of relationships, at least, for the
time being. I'm just afraid that this one trait of mine will carry itself into
my relationship, and will jeopardise my relationship entirely. So I guess I
should just stop trying, really.
