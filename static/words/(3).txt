I've been thinking a lot about death lately.

Not in the "I want to die" kind of way, but more like that I'm worried and
scared about death, since I just can't comprehend what will become of me and my
legacy when I do.

In fact, yesterday, it even made me thought about a plan to pass along messages
and things to the people I trust, both IRL and online. Some kind of a "digital
will," if you can call it that.

I might even go and create an app/service which will automatically figure out if
I'm dead or not (based on my physical and online activities), and once it knows
I'm "dead", it will automatically package my "digital will". I don't know
though, that thing is probably questionable in terms of security and *actually*
being able to figure out my death. Don't want it to think that I'm dead just
because I decided to go off-grid for a certain amount of time.

Am I thinking about this too much?
