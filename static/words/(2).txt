What happened between me and both of you sorta broke me. I was all like, ugh, I
knew I shouldn't have been too quick on all of this, I should have taken love a
lot more seriously.

I've also slowly learned that I will end up having to choose between you two.
More importantly, who I actually love more. Moreover, this choice doesn't only
mean that I have to choose between two of you, there's a huge possibility of the
outcome that I might have to give up both of you and just probably won't give a
fuck about relationships anymore.

I'm sorry. I just need more time by myself. I need more time to think about all
of this. (plus, I have a paper that I need to finish)
