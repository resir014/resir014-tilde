Mastodon is a free and open source (FOSS) federated social network. This means that anyone can host their own Mastodon node, and connect with people in other nodes running Mastodon, GNU Social, or Friendica. Not only that, the source code is available for everyone to build, develop, and scrutinise.

Below is a list of my verified accounts. If you see me posting on one of these nodes, then you can be sure that it's me. See you on the Fediverse!

This is a blanket disclaimer which applies to all instances that I own and included on the preceding list. Should there be changes to these terms, I will notify my followers accordingly.

### Content Warnings

I will make sure to put some posts behind content warnings (CW) where I found necessary (e.g. on political posts, controversial topics, etc.), but be aware that sometimes I will post stuff that are not compatible with your CW standards. If you think certain topics need to be CW'd, you can politely ask me on one of my accounts, and I'll make sure to keep that in mind next time I post about the same topic.
