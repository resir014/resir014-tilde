Mastodon is a free and open source (FOSS) federated social network. This means that anyone can host their own Mastodon node, and connect with people in other nodes running Mastodon, GNU Social, or Friendica. Not only that, the source code is available for everyone to build, develop, and scrutinise.

Below is a list of my verified accounts. If you see me posting on one of these nodes, then you can be sure that it's me. See you on the Fediverse!

## Disclaimer / Terms of Engagement

This is a blanket disclaimer which applies to all instances that I have an account in. Should there be changes to these terms, I will notify my followers accordingly.

### Content Warnings / NSFW posts

I will make sure to tag posts behind content warnings (CW) and/or NSFW where I found necessary (e.g. on political posts, controversial topics, etc.), but be aware that sometimes I will post some untagged stuff that are not compatible with your CW/NSFW standards. If you think certain topics need to be tagged as CW/NSFW, you can politely ask me on one of my accounts, and I'll make sure to keep that in mind next time I post about the same topic.
