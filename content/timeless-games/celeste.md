Celeste is possibly one of the best games I've played in a while. It combines the raw 2D platformer experience with a cutesy storyline about a girl trying to come to terms with her mental health issues. Loving the mixture between the in-game pixel graphics and the illustrations between levels for the game's general artstyle.

It's also hard as hell. The standard levels took me 10.5 hours to complete, along with nearly 3000 deaths.

I'll get to the B-Sides eventually.
