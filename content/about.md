Hey there!

This tilde site was originally set up as a landing page for my actual site at [resir014.xyz](https://resir014.xyz), but then over the course of a few months, I've started slowly transitioning this page into some sort of a catalogue of my interests.

You can also contact me on the following sites:

* Twitter: [@resir014](https://twitter.com/resir014)
* Mastodon: [@resir014@icosahedron.website](https://icosahedron.website/@resir014)
* Tumblr: [resir014.tumblr.com](http://resir014.tumblr.com/)
* GitHub: [resir014](https://github.com/resir014)

Or mail me privately through alpine.
