Hey there!

This tilde site was originally set up as a landing page for my actual blog at [resir014.github.io](https://resir014.github.io), but then over the course of a few months, I've started slowly transitioning this page into some sort of a catalogue of my interests. My new landing page is available [here](https://resir014.xyz/).

You can also contact me on the following sites:

* Twitter: [@resir014](https://twitter.com/resir014)
* Tumblr: [resir014.tumblr.com](http://resir014.tumblr.com/)
* GitHub: [resir014](https://github.com/resir014)

Or mail me privately through alpine.

## About this website

This site is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), uses a slightly-modified version of [Roundabout](http://blvd.space/roundabout), a theme initially designed to be the base of all my websites. It's also available for everyone, so feel free to give it a try!
