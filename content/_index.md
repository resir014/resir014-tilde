# Hello!

Welcome to the tilde page for ~resir014. This tilde page serves as a catalogue of my interests.

You can read more about me <a href="{{< baseurl src="/about/" >}}">here</a>, or here:

$ cat ~resir014/readme.txt

You can also find me here:

* [Mastodon]({{ site.baseurl }}/mastodon) - A fancy distributed social network.
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/resir014) - Where I mostly shitpost about computers and other generic things.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/resir014) - The dumping ground for most of my failed projects.
