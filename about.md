Hey there!

This tilde site was originally set up as a landing page for my actual blog at [resir014.github.io](https://resir014.github.io), but then over the course of a few months, I've started slowly transitioning this page into some sort of a catalogue of my interests. My new landing page is available [here](https://resir014.xyz/).

You can also contact me on the following sites:

* Twitter: [@resir014](https://twitter.com/resir014)
* Tumblr: [resir014.tumblr.com](http://resir014.tumblr.com/)
* GitHub: [resir014](https://github.com/resir014)

Or mail me privately through alpine.

## About this website

This site is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), uses a heavily-modified version of the [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) theme, and is developed on a mid-range laptop I basically use everyday, from doing university works, to playing games.
